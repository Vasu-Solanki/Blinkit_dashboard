# Blinkit_dashboard

ðŸš€ *Excited to Share My Latest Power BI Project!* ðŸš€

I recently completed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, a grocery delivery app, and Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase the insights I gathered throughout the project!

### ðŸŒŸ *Project Highlights:*
*1. Requirement Gathering:* Identified key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating.
*2. Data Walkthrough & Connection:* Connected to relevant data sources to understand and extract necessary information.
*3. Data Cleaning & Quality Check:* Ensured that the data was accurate and ready for analysis through thorough cleaning and validation processes.
*4. Data Modeling & Processing:* Structured the data effectively for analysis and reporting.
*5. DAX Calculations:* Implemented DAX for complex calculations to derive meaningful insights.
*6. Dashboard Layout & Chart Development:* Designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, focusing on the user experience.
*7. Insight Gathering:* Delivered actionable insights through detailed dashboard reporting, driving better business decisions.

This project allowed me to dive deep into the entire process of dashboard development, from gathering requirements to delivering insights that matter.

Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring and refining my skills in Power BI and data analytics. ðŸš€
